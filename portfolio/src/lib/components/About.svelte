	<p class="mx-auto w-full max-w-4xl px-6 text-justify">
		Hey, I’m Nova! 👋 I’m currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at
		Monash University, with a minor in Cybersecurity. My journey in tech has been driven by a deep
		curiosity in software development, a love for solving algorithmic challenges, and a growing
		interest in harnessing the power of big data to solve real-world problems.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p class="mx-auto w-full max-w-4xl px-6 text-justify">
		Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve embraced a variety of roles that shaped my
		technical and interpersonal skills. I recently completed a Software Engineer internship at
		Huddled 💻, where I worked on building robust systems and improving testing infrastructure. I've
		also contributed as the IT Officer for PPI Australia, leading the redesign of digital platforms,
		and served as a Programming Tutor at Monash, helping students write their first lines of code
		and deepen their understanding of core computing concepts.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p class="mx-auto w-full max-w-4xl px-6 text-justify">
		I’m actively seeking graduate roles in the tech industry 🖥️ roles where I can bring creativity,
		discipline, and a team-first mindset to contribute to impactful projects. I’m excited by
		opportunities that push me to learn, collaborate with talented people, and deliver solutions
		that truly matter. Whether it’s front-end interfaces, backend logic, or everything in between, I
		love crafting tech that’s both functional and thoughtful.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p class="mx-auto w-full max-w-4xl px-6 text-justify">
		Beyond the screen, I recharge by spending time outdoors. You’ll often find me at the driving
		range working on my golf swing ⛳️ or taking evening walks to unwind while vibing to chill RnB
		and indie pop playlists 🎧 Wave to Earth has been on repeat lately. Music and movement keep me
		grounded, and I find inspiration in moments of calm just as much as in lines of code.
